📈 Insights:

Majority of data points fall between 5-10% diabetes prevalence, showing this is the common range across continents.

Higher total deaths appear concentrated in North & South America, possibly indicating a stronger correlation between diabetes and mortality in these regions.

Oceania exhibits a wide range of diabetes prevalence but with lower total deaths, suggesting regional healthcare differences or other influencing factors.

This visualization helps in understanding global health trends and potential risks associated with diabetes prevalence. 

2️⃣ 📊 New Cases Per Million by Continent

🔍 Visualization Overview:

This bar chart visualizes the total number of new COVID-19 cases per million people across different continents.

📌 Key Features:

X-Axis: Continent names

Y-Axis: Total new cases per million people (formatted for readability)

Color Coding: The bars are colored red to highlight the severity of cases

Grid & Formatting: Enhanced readability with properly formatted large numbers

📈 Insights:

Differences in total cases across continents highlight regional variations in COVID-19 spread.

Some continents have significantly higher cases per million, indicating regions that faced more severe outbreaks.

Population density, healthcare systems, and government policies may have influenced these numbers, making it an important dataset for further investigation.

This visualization provides a high-level view of how different continents experienced COVID-19 outbreaks.

3️⃣ 🏥 ICU Patients by Continent

🔍 Visualization Overview:

This bar chart presents the total number of ICU patients due to COVID-19 across different continents.

📌 Key Features:

X-Axis: Continent names

Y-Axis: Total ICU patients (formatted with commas for better readability)

Color Coding: Magenta bars emphasize the critical nature of ICU admissions

Grid & Formatting: Improved visualization for clearer insights

📈 Insights:

Regional disparities in ICU admissions can indicate differences in healthcare capacity, severity of cases, and government responses.

Higher ICU patient numbers might correspond to countries with more severe outbreaks or larger healthcare infrastructures.

Analyzing this data with hospital capacity statistics can provide a deeper understanding of healthcare strain during the pandemic.

This visualization helps assess the global impact of COVID-19 on intensive care units. 

4️⃣ Total COVID-19 Cases & Deaths by Continent

🔍 Visualization Overview:

This bar chart provides a comparative view of total COVID-19 cases and deaths across different continents.

📌 Key Features:

X-Axis: Continents

Y-Axis: Total count of new cases and new deaths (formatted with commas for clarity)

Color Coding:

🟩 Green bars represent the total number of COVID-19 cases

🟥 Red bars indicate the total number of COVID-19 deaths

Stacked comparison: Helps assess the fatality ratio by visually comparing cases vs. deaths

📈 Insights:

Higher case counts in some continents may indicate larger populations, better testing, or more widespread outbreaks.

Death-to-case ratio gives insights into the severity of the pandemic in different regions.

Some continents might show disproportionate deaths despite lower case numbers, hinting at healthcare challenges or varying response strategies.

This visualization is crucial for understanding global pandemic trends and evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on different continents.

5️⃣💰 Case Fatality Rate (CFR) by GDP Category

🔍 Visualization Overview:

This bar chart examines the relationship between a country's wealth (GDP per capita) and its COVID-19 Case Fatality Rate (CFR).

📌 Key Features:

X-Axis: Categorized GDP levels (Low, Middle, High)

Y-Axis: Average Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of deaths among confirmed cases

Color Coding:

🔴 Red → Low GDP countries

🟠 Orange → Middle GDP countries

🟢 Green → High GDP countries

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/554bab9c-f13c-41f7-bfc7-83696cadf684)

📈 Insights:

Higher CFR in Low GDP countries could indicate weaker healthcare infrastructure, fewer medical resources, and limited access to vaccines or treatments.

Middle GDP nations may show intermediate CFR values, suggesting a mix of healthcare quality and accessibility.

Lower CFR in High GDP countries implies that better medical facilities, testing, and treatment options contribute to better survival rates.

This visualization highlights the global inequality in healthcare and its direct impact on pandemic outcomes. 🌍📊

6️⃣ COVID-19 Correlation Matrix 🔥

📊 Purpose: This heatmap showcases the relationship between key healthcare and COVID-19 impact metrics.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df2eeb4e-1f48-480d-8e8b-09a60ffb3cee)

🔍 Key Insights:

Total Deaths & ICU Admissions 🏥 → Strong correlation might indicate that higher ICU admissions are linked to increased fatalities.

Hospital Beds & Life Expectancy 🛏️📈 → Examines whether better healthcare infrastructure improves survival rates.

Positive Rate & Deaths ⚠️ → Helps determine if higher infection rates translate into increased mortality.

🎨 Color Interpretation:

🔴 Red Shades → Strong positive correlation (closer to +1)

🔵 Blue Shades → Strong negative correlation (closer to -1)

⚪ Neutral Areas → Weak or no correlation

This heatmap is essential for understanding how different factors interplay in the COVID-19 crisis. 🚀
